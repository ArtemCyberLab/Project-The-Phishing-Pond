Project Goal:
The Phishing Pond is a specialized educational platform designed to quantitatively assess and subsequently enhance user awareness in the field of cybersecurity. The project aims to minimize risks associated with the human factor by simulating real-world phishing attacks in a controlled environment.

Description and Mechanics:
The project is a step-by-step simulator of a corporate email environment. The user is placed in the role of an employee whose inbox becomes a target for a series of targeted attacks.

Procedure:

Sequential Exposure: The participant is presented with 10 unique email scenarios, each corresponding to different social engineering tactics.

Analysis and Classification: For each email, the user must conduct a verification by analyzing a set of key parameters:

Source Authenticity: Analysis of the sender's domain for signs of spoofing.

Request Context: Assessment of the legitimacy of the action requested (clicking a link, opening an attachment, disclosing credentials).

Signs of Manipulation: Identification of psychological triggers, such as artificial urgency or authority-based pressure.

Technical Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): Detection of suspicious URLs, inconsistencies in email structure, and requests to enable macros.

Decision Making: Based on the analysis, the user must classify the email as "Phishing" or "Legitimate."

Covered Attack Vectors (based on provided examples):

Spoofing Legitimate Services (e.g., paypel.trustedvendor-example.com).

Fraudulent Credential Harvesting under the guise of IT support.

Malware Distribution via documents requiring macro enablement.

Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks involving requests to purchase gift cards.

Each of the 10 levels demonstrates an escalation in the complexity and realism of the attacks, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the user's vigilance.

Conclusion and Practical Value:
Completing The Phishing Pond simulator provides organizations and individual professionals with objective data on their vulnerability to social engineering. The project not only identifies knowledge gaps but actively addresses them through practical experience, fostering lasting behavioral patterns.

The outcome is not merely "completing a game," but the development of a professional habit of critically assessing incoming correspondence. This directly reduces information security risks and strengthens the human layer of defense, making it a strategic asset for any security posture.
